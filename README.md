# Mindgruve Style Guide

This style guide template is meant to provide a baseline for future development projects.

Using config.ini, you can quickly set up a style guide page with all the necessary markup to review a complete set of
html elements. You can even use it for more complex markup like Bootstrap Components.

To get started:

1. Run `composer require mindgruve/style-guide` in the application root.
2. Run `composer style-guide generate www/style-guide` to install the basic style guide mini-site to www/style-guide in your project.
3. Add all the styles and javascript you use in your site to the __mgStyleGuide.ini__ in the __config__ directory.
