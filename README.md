# Mindgruve Style Guide

This style guide template is meant to provide a baseline for future development projects.

Using config.ini, you can quickly set up a style guide page with all the necessary markup to review a complete set of
html elements. You can even use it for more complex markup like Bootstrap Components.

To get started simply run `composer require mindgruve/style-guide` and add all the styles and javascript you use in your site to the
config.ini in this directory.
